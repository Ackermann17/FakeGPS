# FakeGPS

This is an android application for "faking" your phone's gps location. This app allows the user to choose any specific location in the world and spoof this location to the phone, tricking it into thinking you are somewhere else. For example, if you choose a location of Paris, then open Google Maps, it will show you that you are in Paris. You can also specify your spoofed location very precisely, for example a crossroads of two streets.
